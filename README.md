👋 Hi, I’m @Shoxuxshokirov!
👀 I’m interested in UI/UX design and web development, as well as exploring the history and landmarks of the Qashqadaryo region, especially the Dehqonobod district.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced web design techniques and experimenting with new UX patterns.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative web projects, especially those focused on user experience and design.
